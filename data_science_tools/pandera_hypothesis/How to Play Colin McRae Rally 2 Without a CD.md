Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. There are several patches and fixes available online that can allow players to run the game without a CD. These patches and fixes are also known as No-CD or No-DVD patches, and they work by modifying the game's executable file (CMR2.EXE) to bypass the CD check. However, not all patches and fixes are compatible with all versions of the game, so players need to make sure they download the correct one for their game.
 
One of the most popular and reliable sources for No-CD patches and fixes is GameBurnWorld[^1^], which offers patches and fixes for various versions of Colin McRae Rally 2, such as v1.0 [ENGLISH], v1.5 [US] and [ALL] No Intro Fix. To use these patches and fixes, players need to follow these steps:

4. Replace the original CMR2.EXE file with the copied file.
5. Double-click or import the COLIN.REG file (if included in the patch or fix) to update the Windows registry.
6. Run the game normally without inserting the CD.

Another source for No-CD patches and fixes is MegaGames[^2^], which offers a patch for Colin McRae Rally 2 v1.09 ENG by Xeno86. This patch works similarly to the ones from GameBurnWorld, but it does not require a COLIN.REG file. To use this patch, players need to follow these steps:

5. Run the game normally without inserting the CD.

Using these patches and fixes can help players enjoy Colin McRae Rally 2 without any hassle or limitation. However, players should be aware that these patches and fixes may not work with some anti-virus software or online services, and they may also violate some terms of service or copyright laws.
