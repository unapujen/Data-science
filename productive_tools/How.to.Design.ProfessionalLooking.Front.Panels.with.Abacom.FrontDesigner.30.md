## What is Abacom FrontDesigner 3.0?
 
Abacom FrontDesigner 3.0 is a software that allows you to design front panels for your electronic devices. You can use it to draw rectangles, polygons, ellipses, labels, drillings, and other objects on a virtual panel. You can also group objects into complex symbols and edit them with functions such as rotation, stretching, mirroring, drilling, milling, etc. You can also create rounded and interpolated contours and chamfers for a more realistic look.
 
Abacom FrontDesigner 3.0 also comes with a predefined and user-editable library of symbols and labels for common electronic components such as switches, potentiometers, instruments, LEDs, etc. You can also use the scale-assistant to create scales for these components easily.
