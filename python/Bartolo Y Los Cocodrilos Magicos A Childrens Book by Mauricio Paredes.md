The book begins with Bartolo reading a book about crocodiles in his room. He is fascinated by these animals and wishes he could see one in real life. He decides to go to the zoo with his friends, but they are disappointed to find out that the crocodile exhibit is closed for maintenance. Bartolo then notices a sign that says "Do not enter" and decides to sneak in. He finds a hidden door that leads to the sewers, where he meets a group of friendly crocodiles who can talk and do magic.
 
The crocodiles explain that they are part of a secret organization called the Crocodile Brotherhood, whose mission is to protect the world from an evil wizard named Zanfiro. Zanfiro hates books and wants to destroy them all with his army of rats. The crocodiles have been collecting books from different places and hiding them in their underground library. They invite Bartolo to join them and help them stop Zanfiro's plan.
 
Bartolo agrees and becomes friends with the crocodiles, who teach him how to use magic and show him their amazing library. He also learns that each crocodile has a special power related to a type of book, such as adventure, mystery, horror, or comedy. Together, they go on various missions to save books from Zanfiro's attacks, such as rescuing a fairy tale book from a haunted castle, or retrieving a science fiction book from a spaceship.
 
However, Zanfiro soon discovers Bartolo's involvement and decides to kidnap him and use him as bait to lure the crocodiles into a trap. He also reveals his ultimate weapon: a giant machine that can erase all the words from every book in the world. Bartolo and the crocodiles must use their courage, intelligence, and imagination to defeat Zanfiro and save the books before it's too late.
